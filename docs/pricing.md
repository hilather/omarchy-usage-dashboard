# Pricing policy

API value uses token categories and the price snapshot shipped with this version. The bundled LiteLLM subset contains OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini entries and the price fields consumed by the collector. Its source revision, URL, and retrieval time are embedded in `catalog.json`.

The OpenCode Go model override is kept separately in `pricing.json`, with its documentation source and verification date. Matching is exact or uses the provider-prefixed catalog key. There is no guessed price for an unknown model.

Muse Spark 1.3 rates live in `muse-pricing.json` with their documentation source and verification date: per million tokens, Standard input $1.25, output $4.25, cached input $0.15; Contributor input $0.10, output $0.20, cached input $0.002. Muse records no per-request cost estimate, so unlike Grok there is no recorded figure to take precedence; catalog rates are the only source. This is the API-equivalent value, not subscription spending. No cache-write rate is published, so records with nonzero cache writes stay unpriced; Muse reasoning is recorded separately and excluded from value, as with Codex and Grok.

Devin rates live in `devin-pricing.json`, generated from `devin models list --format json`, which reports per-million input, cached-input, and output prices for every model variant on the account catalog. Devin records no per-request cost estimate; catalog rates are the only source. This is the API-equivalent value, not ACU or subscription spending. No cache-write rate is published, so records with nonzero cache writes stay unpriced. Models without a listed price (including the `swe-*` and `adaptive` tiers) remain unpriced rather than guessed.

Grok Build uses `usage.costUsdTicks` from completed turns, divided by 10 billion to obtain USD. Per-model values take precedence; an aggregate value is used only for a single-model turn. Missing or zero ticks remain unpriced, even if a similarly named catalog model exists. This is Grok’s API-equivalent estimate, not subscription spending. Cache savings cannot be derived from this figure and are excluded from known cache savings.

A catalog-priced record is unpriced if any nonzero token category lacks an applicable rate. Its tokens remain counted, its estimated value is omitted, and the UI identifies incomplete pricing. A catalog's explicit zero rate is distinct from a missing rate.

Cache reads and cache writes use their respective rates. Claude's one-hour write counter is a subset of cache writes, and is charged separately when reported. Context-tier thresholds are applied only where the catalog defines them. Reasoning is not added again to Codex or Grok output; OpenCode's separate reasoning counter is included in output.

OpenCode, Pi, and Oh My Pi use a positive API estimate recorded by the app when present. Zero or missing recorded costs fall back to exact catalog matches; they are not assumed to mean free usage. Gemini output includes its separate thinking count. Pi reasoning is already included in output. These app estimates are not invoices and do not establish remaining subscription allowance.

User override: place a JSON object containing `source`, optional `fetchedAtMs`, and a `document` map in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/omarchy/ai-usage/rates.json`. User entries override matching bundled and official entries; other bundled models remain available. The documented Go, Muse, and Devin overrides apply underneath the user catalog. Delete the override to return to the bundled snapshot. The app does not download catalog updates automatically.

Maintainers can run `python3 tools/update_catalog.py COMMIT_SHA` to regenerate the LiteLLM subset from an explicit public revision. Review price changes and upstream licensing before release. Go overrides are reviewed against their own documented source.

Grok completed turns can contain many model calls. The dashboard labels aggregated message/turn rows as usage records and shows Grok model calls separately. They are not interchangeable request counts.

Gemini 3.8 Flash standard rates were checked against [Google’s pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) on September 5, 2026: $0.75 input, $3.75 output, and $0.075 cache reads per million tokens. These promotional rates end December 31, 2026. Cache storage, grounding tools, and service-tier premiums are not calculated from local token categories. Other snapshot entries are attributed catalog data, not a claim that every rate was independently verified.
