# Accounts and history folders

Open Settings, name the default local history group if needed, then choose **Add account**. Give it a unique name and add one or more source folders. Save preferences to scan them.

| Source | Folder to select |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Agent home containing `sessions` or `archived_sessions` |
| Claude Code | Agent home containing `projects` |
| Grok Build | Agent home containing `sessions` |
| Gemini CLI | Agent home containing `tmp` |
| OpenCode / OpenCode Go | Data folder containing `opencode.db` or `storage/message` |
| Pi / Oh My Pi | Agent folder containing `sessions` |
| Muse | Data home containing `sessions` |
| Cursor | Cloud usage only; sign in to the Cursor desktop app (no folders to add) |

An account can combine Codex, Claude, and other source folders. OpenCode and OpenCode Go need separate source entries to label both sets of routes in the same database. Folders must already be available locally or mounted. No remote sync or credentials are configured here. Missing folders appear in source coverage and can be connected later.

The account filter applies to charts, totals, and breakdowns. The Accounts table compares account/source pairs and opens their recorded sessions. Renaming an account changes its label without reimporting tokens.

## Copies and retained history

Stable event IDs deduplicate copied sessions across folders. Multiple copies under the same account count once. A named copy takes precedence over an unlabelled copy. If copies of an event belong to different named accounts, the event counts once under **Needs review**, with a warning. Move the mirrored folders into the same account to resolve it. For nested configured folders, the most specific folder wins.

The ledger retains previously recorded usage after source files disappear. Older records whose source cannot be recovered during migration appear as **Unassigned history**. They remain in overall totals. Removing an account label keeps its history and returns its known source paths to the local group unless another configured account matches them. Unlabelled additional folders also belong to the local group.

## Limits and comparisons

History labels are not verified login identities. The All accounts view displays only the current login's quota on this PC, with its scope stated. Account-filtered views hide quota. This version does not switch authentication or fetch every account's limits.

Optional monthly prices apply only to the local history group. Imported, conflicting, and unassigned histories do not inherit that price. API estimates still use the same recorded costs and catalog rules in every account view.

Averages divide period activity by distinct recorded sessions. Sessions are not completed tasks, and differently sized tasks cannot establish relative model efficiency. API-value shares and averages include only priced usage; unknown rates remain visibly unpriced.
